\arguments{
\item{model}{string, ID of the model to use. You can use the list models
(https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models/list)
API to see all of your available models, or see our model overview
(https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview)
for descriptions of them.}

\item{prompt}{API endpoint parameter}

\item{suffix}{string/NULL, the suffix that comes after a completion
of inserted text.}

\item{max_tokens}{integer, the maximum number of tokens
(https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to generate
in the completion. The token count of your prompt plus max_tokens cannot
exceed the model's context length.}

\item{temperature}{double, what sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2.
Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random,
while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.}

\item{top_p}{double, an alternative to sampling with temperature,
called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens
with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising
the top 10\% probability mass are considered.}

\item{n}{integer, How many completions to generate for each prompt.
Note: Because this parameter generates many completions,
it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully
and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.}

\item{stream}{flag, Whether to stream back partial progress. If set,
tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available,
with the stream terminated by a data: `[DONE]` message.}

\item{logprobs}{integer, Include the log probabilities on the logprobs most
likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if logprobs is 5,
the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always
return the logprob of the sampled token, so there may be up to logprobs+1
elements in the response.}

\item{echo}{logical, echo back the prompt in addition to the completion}

\item{stop}{string or array, up to 4 sequences where the API will stop
generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.}

\item{presence_penalty}{double, Number between -2.0 and 2.0.
Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text
so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.}

\item{frequency_penalty}{double, Number between -2.0 and 2.0.
Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency
in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line
verbatim.}

\item{best_of}{integer, Generates best_of completions server-side and returns
the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results
cannot be streamed.
When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions
and n specifies how many to return â€“ best_of must be greater than n.}

\item{user}{string, A unique identifier representing your end-user,
which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse}

\item{api_key}{string, OpenAI API key
(see https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)}
}
\value{
\link[httr]{content} of the httr \link[httr]{response} object
or SimpleError (\link[base]{conditions}) enhanced with
two additional fields: `status_code` (response$status_code)
and `message_long` (built on response content)
}

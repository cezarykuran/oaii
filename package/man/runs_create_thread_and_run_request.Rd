execute this run. If a value is provided here, it will override the model associated with the assistant. If not, the

modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.}

\item{tools}{NULL/named list, override the tools the assistant can use for this run. This is useful for modifying the
behavior on a per-run basis. Example:
# code interpreter tool
list(

# or retrieval tool
list(
  type = "retrieval"
)
# or function tool
list(
  type = "retrieval",

    # list (optional), the parameters the functions accepts. See the guide

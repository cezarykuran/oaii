\usage{
demo(host = "0.0.0.0", port = 38383)
}
\arguments{
\item{host}{The IPv4 address that the application should listen on. Defaults
to the \code{shiny.host} option, if set, or \code{"127.0.0.1"} if not. See
Details.}

\item{port}{The TCP port that the application should listen on. If the
\code{port} is not specified, and the \code{shiny.port} option is set (with
\code{options(shiny.port = XX)}), then that port will be used. Otherwise,
use a random port between 3000:8000, excluding ports that are blocked
by Google Chrome for being considered unsafe: 3659, 4045, 5060,
5061, 6000, 6566, 6665:6669 and 6697. Up to twenty random
ports will be tried.}

# OpenAI API R implementation

This is an early version of an R library aimed at streamlining communication with the OpenAI API.

**The oaii package offers the following features:**

- A comprehensive set of helper functions for seamless communication with API.
- Useful tools for efficient data manipulation and transformation.
- An interactive Shiny demo application, which can be accessed at https://cezarykuran.shinyapps.io/oaii/ (feel free to explore its functionality!).
- Several demonstration terminal applications written as R scripts. These applications serve as practical examples, demonstrating how to effectively leverage the package's functions for API communication.

**Endpoint helpers implemented so far:**

- files
- fine tunes
- completions
- models  
- chat
- image generator, image editor (rather for fun)

## Repo structure
